# Project Proposal
Me and Jai decided to each search for 3 data sets each and come back together to collectively pick a data set that would be the best fit for us. 
Jai's Data sets - Bus operators, council CCTV cameras and Student Accomodation
Anas's Data sets - Tourism, Bus stops and Student Accomodation
After we both went away to look for 3 data sets each, we both collectively chose student accomodation as our data set because we both agreed that it was a topic that we can build a website around and something we are familiar with.

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Most student accommodation websites focus on listing rooms, locations, and booking options and often miss a vital aspect: building community and compatibility among students. Moving into student accommodation can be challenging, especially when sharing space with unfamiliar people. Our website aims to go beyond the usual roommate matching system by including compatibility features based on things like habits, noise tolerance, shared interests and even course schedule compatibility. By offering these types of filters for students, we aim to foster harmonious, well-matched living environments that support students academic and personal growth, enhancing their experience beyond just finding a place to stay. We can therefore also aim to integrate virtual meet-and-greets or intrest circles for groups with similar intrests like sports, gaming or volunteering befure moving in, helping students feel more connected and supported in their new accommodation.

### Business benefits
Living with compatible rommates can reduce common stressors around clashing lifestyles, noise tolerance and study schedules. By matching students based on shared habits and preferences, the platform promotes harmonious living enviorments helping students feel more relaxed and supported. Other benefits of this website maybe that students who feel comfortable and connected in their living enviroment are less likely to move out or change accommodations which can lead to higher satisfaction rates which benefits both the students and the accommodation website. Also, when students are well-matched from the start, potential conflicts over lifestyle differences are minimized by helping students find rommatees with compatible habits and personalities, the platform proactively supports more postive long lasting living arrangements.

### Options Considered
Some perks we aim to include in our website would be to integrate virtual meet-and-greet between students who are potentially going to be accommodated with each other to build early connections and reduce anxiety, it can also give students a chance to communicate expectations, routines or boundaries before living with eachother which helps reduce potential conflicts setting a solid foundation for respecting and cooperative living arrangements. By profiding filters that cater to lifestyle preferences, the platform can help students from different backgrounds feel comfortable and respected because this feature promotes a more inclusive enviroment where students feel valued and understood regardless of their individual routines or cultural practices which resolves potential confilicts over lifestyle differences when the students are well matched so that each and every student feels a sense of belonging, making the transition to a new enviroment easier. 

### Expected Risks
Some risks we could come across could be mismatch of expectations, even with compatibility features there is always a chance students wont get along as expected because lifeestyle changes, evolving schedules or unexpected personality defferences could lead to dissatisfaction or rommate conflicts however a system for handling mismatches or mediating conflicts would help solve this issue. Some other risks with this website maybe unintentional bias and discrimination because a matching system based on personal preferences could lead to exlusionary practices meaning that this might unintentionally encourage students to choose rommates who are similar to them, which could reduce diversity. To avoid this the feature should be designed with a focus on inclusivity. Creating a matching platform that involves user data, perefences and potential rommate pairing comes with legal and regulatory responsibilities meaning that compliance with data protection laws like gdpr and anti-discrimkination laws is essential. Problems with legal responsibilities may arise if users experience harm or discrimination as a result of matches made by the platform so a solution to this maybe clear terms of service and user agreements and to implement stronger screening and verification procedures for both students and landlords and to also e transparent about how the matching process works and any algorithms used. Accountability can help build user trust and reduce the likelihood of negative experiences.
