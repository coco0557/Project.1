# Project Proposal
stage 1 - choosing a data type:
Jai's list:
1 - Council CCTV cameras
2 - Bus operator by service 
3 - Student accomidation



Anas's list:
student accomidation - just a map. can created as a normal web app
tourist information - just  a map, but last updated in 2011 (outdated)
Bus stops 

Final: Student accomidation. - Anas and i both agreed upon Student Accomidation

ideas: 
- location of local grocery stores and restruants, 
- daily advertisment of local events - happy hours, quiz, comedie and kareokee
- access to public transport 
- crime hotspots


## Business Case

### Problem statement
We both found that Open Data Bristol data was outdated and last updated on the 16th February 2024. Students usually look for accomidation in august before their course begins, this means some accomidations will no longer be available. The project is to create a better web app for Showcasing student accomidation. Open Data Bristol's database for student accomidation is composed of a map, in the map, available accomidations are highlighted by a yellow colour. This design is very simple however it does not show in detail what the apartments look like, or the local area. 

TODO: Replace the example text like this with text that describes your project. What is the problem to be addressed?

### Business benefits
The high-level benefits this project will provide is what the existing page lacks, these include:
1. Images of the available properties
2. Public transport which highlights key-tourist / student attractions, these include; SS Great Britan, Clifton suspension bridge, M shed, Bristol aquarium, st nicholas market and many more
3. The idea is to become more than just a web app for student accomidation. IT will showcase daily advertisement of local events - happy hours, quiz nights, comedy shows and kareoke.
TODO: List high-level benefits that this product will provide.

### Options Considered
the idea is to create a web app that will offer services which are not provided by other sites, these services include the likes of student specific deals and discounts on services along the lines of; cleaning, internet or furniture, helping students save time by not having to search multiple sites accross the internet as it will all be in one place, useful features such as filters for locations, budgets and room types allow the students to find an accomidation which suits their needs best.

TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?

### Expected Risks
Som risks which we may come accross could be the likes of availability issues as popular listings would be also posted on other sites and will therefore be hard to maintain the accomidations which are listed. Anothrt risk we may face is Cyber Attacks and Data Breaches, the likes of these would greatly comprimise the users private data and information which may lead to fake listings and offers from users which are not interested. The result of this is that it can harm trust which we have built with customers, also, can lead to financial loses for thr students.
TODO: What are the main risks of this project?
