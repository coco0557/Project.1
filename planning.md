# Project Proposal
stage 1 - choosing a data type:
Jai's list:
1 - Council CCTV cameras
2 - Bus operator by service 
3 - Student accomidation



Anas's list:
student accomidation - just a map. can created as a normal web app
tourist information - just  a map, but last updated in 2011 (outdated)
Bus stops 

Final: Student accomidation. - Anas and i both agreed upon Student Accomidation as we both found that Bristol Open Data's data was outdated and last updated in february 2024. Students usually look for accomidation in august before their course begins.

ideas: 
- location of local grocery stores and restruants, 
- daily advertisment of local events - happy hours, quiz, comedie and kareokee
- access to public transport 
- crime hotspots
