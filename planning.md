# Project Proposal
Me and Jai decided to each search for 3 data sets each and come back together to collectively pick a data set that would be the best fit for us. 
Jai's Data sets - Bus operators, council CCTV cameras and Student Accomodation
Anas's Data sets - Tourism, Bus stops and Student Accomodation
We both went away to look for 3 data sets each we both collectively chose student accomodation as our data set because we both agreed that it was a topic that we can agree on.
## Business Case
Problem statement - This web app aims to simplify the process of finding and securing housing for students that are looking for universities and provide a user-friendly website which connects students to possible accomodations in their area.
Benefits - The benefits of this web app would be that students can easily search for housing options based of their budget, location and preference.
Options - Direct communication could be one of the perks of using the web app as we plan to have useful links that connect the student to the university on possible accomodation inquiries.
Costs - 
Risks - Some risks we may come across could be availability issues because popular listins may be already taken or may find it hard securing their preferred accomodation if they do not act fast. Another risk maybe that our webiste may not cover all areas comprehensively, which may lead to limited options in certain areas for students.
